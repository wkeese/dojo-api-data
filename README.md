dojo-api-data
=============

This is the static HTML and tree.json files that the Dojo API would generate using spider.php / spider.js.
It can be used for static viewing of API files.

Note the context path for API links has been set to /api/{version}.

Also, note that the boilerplate CSS, JS, and image files in this directory should not be edited directly;
the master copies are in https://github.com/lbod/dapi.

Clone this locally into a directory called api-data via:

$ git clone https://github.com/wkeese/dojo-api-data.git api-data
